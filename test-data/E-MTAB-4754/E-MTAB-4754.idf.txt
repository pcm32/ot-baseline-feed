Experiment Description	This experiment contains a subset of data from the BLUEPRINT Epigenome project ( http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu ), which aims at producing a reference haemopoetic epigenomes for the research community.   4 samples of primary cells from tonsil with cell surface markes CD20med/CD38high in young individuals (3 to 10 years old) are included in this experiment. This ArrayExpress record contains only meta-data.  Raw data files have been archived at the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA, www.ebi.ac.uk/ega) by the consortium, with restricted access to protect sample donors' identity.  The relevant accessions of EGA data sets is EGAD00001001523. Details on how to apply for data access via the BLUEPRINT data access committee are on the EGA data set pages.  The mapping of samples to these EGA accessions can be found in the 'Sample Data Relationship Format' file of this ArrayExpress record. Information on individual samples and sequencing libraries can also be found on the BLUEPRINT data coordination centre (DCC) website: http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu

Protocol Description	Total RNA from plasma cells were extracted using Illustra triplePrep kit (General Electric) and quality assessed by Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies).	300ng of mRNA was used as starting materials and sequencing library was prepared as described in the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Guide.  Fragment size was about 200bp.	The individuals contributing to the tonsillar plasma cells were recruited following the standards and recommendations of the Ethics Committee at the Hospital Universidad de Navarra (Pamplona, Spain)and the declaration of Helsinki.  Tonsillar plasma cells were separated from children tonsils obtained from the Clinica Universidad de Navarra. Tonsils were minced extensively and after Ficoll-Isopaque density centrifugation, enrichment of CD19+ cells was performed by using the AutoMACS system (Milteny Biotec, Auburn, CA). Plasma cells (CD20med/CD38high) were separated by FACS sorting after labeling with anti-CD20 FITC (BD Biosciences) and anti-CD38 APC (BD Biosciences). Purity of the cell population was confirmed by 2-color flow cytometry using CD45+PerCP/CD138+ PE criteria (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) and exceeded 90%.
